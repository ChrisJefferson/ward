The ext/ directory contains external software that is distributed under its own
copyright. See the relevant subdirectories for notes on how these pieces of
software can be copied and reused.

Most of the software is unmodified. The exception is the Lua 5.1.4 distribution
that required some modifications for the build process. These modifications
include removing the dependency on the GNU readline library and also allows
the external configuration of the LUA_ROOT directory via a preprocessor
#define.
